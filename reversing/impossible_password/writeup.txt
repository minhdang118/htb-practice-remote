1. Execute the binary file and observe that it takes a string and output the input string itself.
2. Open the binary file with Hex Editor and find string "SuperSeKretKey".
3. Execute again, this time with input "SuperSeKretKey".
4. The program switches to a different mode where no input string generates any output.
5. Run again with ltrace, this time observing that the program compares the input string with a random string.
6. Disassemble the main function with Radare2, find 2 secret functions fcn.0040078d() and fcn.00400978().
7. Disassemble fcn.0040078d() and find that it runs the random function multiple times to create the random string.
8. Closely observe the main disassembly, find the condition at which fcn.00400978() runs.
9. Change the disassembly code so that fcn.00400978() always runs.
10. Execute the program again, with the second input being any random string.
11. Captured the Flag!
